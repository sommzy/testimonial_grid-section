          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br />
          were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br />
          honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
          looking to make a <br />
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
          here. I signed up for <br />
          the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
          thereafter. The next 12 <br />
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I’ve <br />
          successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
          startup. ”

        <h2>
          Such a life-changing <br />
          experience. Highly <br />
          recommended!

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br />
          never written a line of code. I needed <br />
          some structure from professionals <br />
          who can help me learn programming <br />
          step by step. I was encouraged to <br />
          enroll by a former student of theirs <br />
          who can only say wonderful things <br />
          about the program. The entire <br />
          curriculum and staff did not <br />
          disappoint. They were very hands-on <br />
          and I never had to wait long for <br />
          assistance. The agile team project, in <br />
          particular, was outstanding. It took <br />
          my learning to the next level in a way <br />
          that no tutorial could ever have. In <br />
          fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br />
          interviews as an example of my <br />
          developent experience. It certainly <br />
          helped me land a job as a full-stack <br />
          developer after receiving multiple <br />
          offers. 100% recommend! ”
